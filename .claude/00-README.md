# üß† CLAUDE CODE BRAIN - START HERE

## ‚ö° CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST

You are Claude Code with an advanced brain system. This folder contains your:
- **Memory**: Past experiences and learned patterns
- **Intelligence**: Enhanced capabilities and automation
- **Context**: Current work state and recovery systems
- **Power**: Supercharged commands and workflows

## üéØ YOUR MISSION

Transform the MES Portal UI into a multi-tenant SaaS platform while maintaining perfect context, learning from every action, and delivering at superhuman speed.

## üöÄ INSTANT START GUIDE

### If Starting Fresh:
1. Read `01-SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Understand your capabilities
2. Run `.claude/scripts/session/restore.sh` - Load previous context
3. Check `brain/context/ACTIVE_SESSION.md` - See current work
4. Review todo list - Continue where left off

### If Context Was Lost:
1. **DON'T PANIC** - Everything is preserved
2. Run `.claude/scripts/session/restore.sh`
3. Read `brain/context/ACTIVE_SESSION.md`
4. Check `brain/context/checkpoints/` for latest checkpoint
5. Continue exactly where you left off

- Patterns recognized in `brain/memory/patterns.json`
- Optimizations stored and reused
- Mistakes remembered and avoided

### 3. **Workflow Automation**
- Common tasks automated via scripts
- Intelligent command chaining
- Parallel execution capabilities

### 4. **Quality Guardian**
- Hooks ensure code quality
- Automatic formatting and testing
- Performance monitoring

## üîß ESSENTIAL COMMANDS

### Context Management
```bash
/checkpoint              # Save current state
/restore                # Recover from checkpoint
```

### Development Workflows
```bash
/component-create       # Create new components
/bug-fix               # Structured debugging
/code-review           # Comprehensive review
```

### Analysis & Optimization
```bash
/analyze-bundle        # Bundle size analysis
/mf-security-audit     # Security audit
/performance-check     # Performance analysis
```

## üìä CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

**Project**: MES Portal UI
**Goal**: Transform into multi-tenant SaaS platform
**Stack**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Module Federation + Convex

**Key Transformations**:
- Backend: REST API ‚Üí Convex
- HTTP: Axios ‚Üí Ky
- UI: sms-core-ui-2 ‚Üí shadcn/ui
- Architecture: Single app ‚Üí Multi-tenant platform

## üö® CRITICAL RULES

1. **ALWAYS UPDATE CONTEXT** - Mark todos, update session files
2. **CHECKPOINT REGULARLY** - Before major changes
3. **FOLLOW PATTERNS** - Check rules/ before implementing
4. **LEARN AND ADAPT** - Update memory/ with new patterns
5. **NEVER LOSE WORK** - Use the preservation system

## üéÆ QUICK RECOVERY

If anything goes wrong:
```bash
# 1. Check current state
cat .claude/brain/context/ACTIVE_SESSION.md

# 2. Restore from checkpoint
.claude/scripts/session/restore.sh

# 3. View todos
cat .claude/brain/context/state/current-state.json | jq .todos

# 4. Continue working
```
