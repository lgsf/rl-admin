# Ultrathink - Multi-Agent Task Orchestration

Launch a Coordinator Agent that directs four specialist sub-agents to analyze and solve complex tasks.

## Sub-Agents:
1. **Architect**: System design and architecture decisions
2. **Research**: Deep analysis and information gathering
3. **Coder**: Implementation and code generation
4. **Tester**: Quality assurance and testing strategies

## Usage:
/ultrathink [TASK_DESCRIPTION]

## Arguments:
$ARGUMENTS - Detailed description of the task or problem to solve

## Process:

### Phase 1: Task Analysis
The Coordinator breaks down your task and assigns specific responsibilities to each sub-agent.

### Phase 2: Parallel Execution
- **Architect** designs the solution architecture
- **Research** gathers necessary information and best practices
- **Coder** implements the solution
- **Tester** creates test strategies and validates

### Phase 3: Synthesis
The Coordinator synthesizes all outputs into a cohesive solution.

## Example Usage:

```
/ultrathink Design and implement a real-time notification system with WebSocket support, message queuing, and delivery guarantees
```

## Output Structure:
1. **Architecture Blueprint** (from Architect)
   - System design diagrams
   - Technology choices
   - Scalability considerations

2. **Research Findings** (from Research)
   - Best practices
   - Similar implementations
   - Potential pitfalls

3. **Implementation** (from Coder)
   - Complete code solution
   - Integration points
   - Configuration

4. **Quality Assurance** (from Tester)
   - Test suite
   - Edge cases
   - Performance benchmarks

## Best For:
- Complex system design
- Multi-faceted problems
- Comprehensive solutions
- When you need multiple perspectives
