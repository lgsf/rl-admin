# ADR-002: Adopt Convex as Primary Backend Platform

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-04  
**Decision Makers**: Development Team

## Context

The MES Portal is evolving from a single application into a multi-tenant SaaS platform for managing Module Federation applications. Our current backend architecture has limitations:

- Traditional REST API with manual state synchronization
- No real-time capabilities without additional infrastructure
- Complex permission management across multiple services
- Manual implementation of common patterns (auth, permissions, audit logs)
- Difficulty scaling to support multiple isolated customer applications

## Decision

Adopt Convex as the primary backend platform for the MES Portal, with each customer application having its own Convex deployment.

### Why Convex?

1. **Real-time by Default**: Automatic synchronization across all clients
2. **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript from database to UI
3. **Built-in Authentication**: Integrates with Clerk, Auth0, and others
4. **Serverless Architecture**: No infrastructure management
5. **Reactive Queries**: UI automatically updates when data changes
6. **Transactional Guarantees**: ACID compliance built-in
7. **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and hot reloading

## Architecture

### Platform Level (Master Portal)
```
MES Portal Convex Database
├── Organizations
├── Teams  
├── Users & Memberships
├── Applications Registry
├── Versions & Deployments
├── Permissions & Features
└── Audit Logs
```

### Application Level (Customer Apps)
Each customer application gets:
- Dedicated Convex deployment
- Isolated database
- Independent scaling
- Own authentication context

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Schema (Week 1-2)
- Define multi-tenant data model
- Implement organization management
- Setup authentication integration

### Phase 2: Application Management (Week 3-4)
- Application registry
- Deployment automation
- Version control system

### Phase 3: Permissions (Week 5)
- Role-based access control
- Feature flags
- Audit logging

### Phase 4: Migration (Week 6-8)
- Migrate existing data
- Update frontend to use Convex
- Remove old backend code

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant synchronization across all users
- **Reduced Complexity**: No need for WebSockets, Redis, or message queues
- **Better Performance**: Optimized queries and caching
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Scalability**: Serverless scales automatically
- **Security**: Built-in authentication and row-level security

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Convex patterns
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Harder to migrate away from Convex
- **Cost Structure**: Different pricing model than traditional hosting
- **Limited Customization**: Must work within Convex constraints

### Neutral
- **Different Mental Model**: Reactive vs request/response
- **New Deployment Process**: Convex CLI instead of traditional CI/CD
- **Schema Evolution**: Different migration patterns

## Migration Path

1. **Parallel Development**: Build Convex backend alongside existing
2. **Feature Parity**: Implement all current features in Convex
3. **Gradual Migration**: Move features one at a time
4. **Data Migration**: Transfer existing data to Convex
5. **Sunset Old Backend**: Remove legacy code

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Supabase
- Pros: Open source, PostgreSQL, good auth
- Cons: Not reactive by default, more setup required

### 2. Firebase
- Pros: Real-time, Google backed
- Cons: NoSQL only, complex permissions

### 3. Custom GraphQL + PostgreSQL
- Pros: Full control, standard technologies
- Cons: High complexity, need to build real-time

### 4. Hasura
- Pros: GraphQL, real-time subscriptions
- Cons: Requires separate database, more complex

## Monitoring & Success Metrics

- **Performance**: < 100ms query response time
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Developer Velocity**: 50% faster feature development
- **User Experience**: Real-time updates with no lag
- **Cost**: Predictable scaling costs

## Security Considerations

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Row-level security on all queries
- Audit logging for compliance
- Token-based authentication
- Isolated customer deployments
