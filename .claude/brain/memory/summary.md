# Development Progress Summary

## Recent Activity

- **[2025-01-04T15:00:00Z]** Platform Architecture Transformation: Designed multi-tenant SaaS platform with Convex backend

- **[2025-01-04T14:30:00Z]** Convex Backend Adoption: Researched and planned migration from REST API to Convex reactive database

- **[2025-01-04T14:00:00Z]** HTTP Client Migration: Selected Ky to replace Axios (85% smaller bundle)

- **[2025-01-04T13:30:00Z]** Module Federation Security: Created comprehensive security audit plan

- **[2025-01-04T13:00:00Z]** shadcn/ui Migration: Established component migration strategy

- **[2025-01-04T12:00:00Z]** Claude Code Integration: Set up .claude directory with commands, hooks, and tracking

## Major Decisions

### Platform Vision
Transforming MES Portal from a single application into a multi-tenant platform for managing Module Federation applications, where each customer app has its own Convex database.

### Technology Stack Updates
1. **Backend**: Convex (replacing traditional REST API)
2. **HTTP Client**: Ky (replacing Axios)
3. **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (replacing sms-core-ui-2)
4. **Architecture**: Multi-tenant with hierarchical permissions

### Key Documents Created
- `CONVEX_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive backend migration strategy
- `MODULE_FEDERATION_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` - Enterprise-grade MF improvements
- `MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md` - Overall modernization roadmap
- `convex_rules.txt` - AI code generation guidelines for Convex

## Current Focus Areas

### In Progress
1. Setting up Convex project and schema
2. Beginning Ky migration with compatibility layer
3. Starting shadcn/ui component migration
4. Implementing multi-tenant organization structure

### Next Steps
1. Configure authentication provider (Clerk/Auth0)
2. Build core Convex schema
3. Create organization management UI
4. Implement first Module Federation remote deployment
5. Set up permission system

## Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Tenant Structure
```
Platform
├── Organizations
│   ├── Teams
│   └── Applications (each with own Convex DB)
└── Centralized Management
    ├── Permissions
    ├── Version Control
    └── Deployment Pipeline
```

### Security Enhancements
- Content Security Policy for Module Federation
- Row-level security in Convex
- Permission-based remote loading
- Comprehensive audit logging

### Performance Goals
- Sub-100ms data queries (Convex)
- 50% bundle size reduction (shadcn/ui + Ky)
- Real-time updates without polling
- < 500ms remote module loading

## Development Velocity
- 7 custom Claude Code commands created
- 4 automated hooks implemented
- 3 architectural decision records documented
- 2 major migration plans completed

## Risk Mitigation
- Gradual migration approach for all changes
- Compatibility layers during transition
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Rollback plans for each phase
