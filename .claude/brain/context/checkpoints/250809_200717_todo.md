Then let's already create the first system group superadmin and admin grouos have access which is this page to send the notifications to other system groups. So we can test the functionality of system groups linked to user, if it is working across the application by the user not being able to see this notfication panel. We also need to assign a default system group upon user creation"

Why didn't you change the user schema to include correctly our new separation of concerns, which is groups if a relation with organization, membership is what validates if that person is still in that organization. All arrays because you can be more than from one system group or group, and obviously you can have more memberships, belong to multiple organizations. I think you need to fix the userSchema first and also fix the function to create users when you are signing up."
